# Debugging (explanation of code line by line)
StudyHard.main.14	
    Program starts > JVM Starts up and enters main method. 
    New Current Stack Frame created.
StudyHard.main.16	
    Scanner gets instantiated.
StudyHard.main.17	
    Local reference variable ‘set1’ gets placed in the current Stack Frame and points to the Object of type WorkHard which has been instantiated into the heap.
WorkHard.<init>:12	
    Since we are entering a new method ‘WorkHard’ stack is created. 
StudyHard.main:21	
    An Input Dialog box is presented to user to get value 1.
StudyHard.main:22	
    The User Entered Input value is (String) is parsed to a double. 
    The Double literal <<user entered value>> is passed from the calling method into the instance variable ‘value1’ in WorkHard.
StudyHard.main:23	
    An Input Dialog box is presented to user to get value 2.
StudyHard.main:24	
    The User Entered Input value is (String) is parsed to a double. 
    The Double literal <<user entered value>> is passed from the calling method into the instance variable ‘value2’ in WorkHard.
StudyHard.main:25	
    An Input Dialog box is presented to user to get value 3.
StudyHard.main:26	
    The User Entered Input value is (String) is parsed to a double. 
    The Double literal <<user entered value>> is passed from the calling method into the instance variable ‘value3’ in WorkHard.
StudyHard.main:27	
    An Input Dialog box is presented to user to get a string.
    And that <<user entered value>> is declared in local variable ‘lowerCase’.
StudyHard.main:30	
    Method ‘outputSumNums()’ is being called from the main class.
    New Stack Frame gets created for this method.
WorkHard.outputSumNums:21	
    The user entered values are passed onto the method and the values are declared to the instance variables (value1, value2, value3) in the ‘WorkHard’ class.
    And the method does what it is programed to do. Calculate the sum of the three variables and store in in variable double ‘sum’.
WorkHard.outputSumNums:24	
    The result ‘sum’ is displayed in dialog box to user. 
WorkHard.outputSumNums:32	
    Method reaches the end of its code and the stack explodes and destroys all its valuable values.
StudyHard.main:33	
    Method ‘returnSumNums()’, is being called and local variable ‘sumReturn’ is declared to catch the return value of that method.
    New Stack Frame gets created for this method.
WorkHard.returnSumNums:38	
    Method runs and the user entered values are passed on to the instance variables ‘value1, value2, value3’ and the method does what it was programmed to do – return the sum of the three values to locally declared variable ‘sum’.
WorkHard.returnSumNums:39	
    The local variable ‘sum’ of type double is asked to return the value. Method ends its job and gets destroyed along with its valuable values.
StudyHard.main:33	
    The method’s result is returned to the calling class and is caught in the local variable ‘sumReturn’ of type double.
StudyHard.main:36	
    The returned variable ‘sumReturn’ is displayed in dialog box to user. 
StudyHard.main:45	
    Method ‘outputAve()’ is being called. 
    A New stack frame gets created in the stack.
WorkHard.outputAve:48	
    The user entered values are passed onto the method and the values are declared to the instance variables (value1, value2, value3) in the ‘WorkHard’ class.
    And the method does what it is programed to do. Calculate the average of the three variables and store in in variable double ‘ave’
WorkHard.outputAve:51	
    The result is displayed in dialog box to user.
WorkHard.outputAve:59	
    The method reaches its end and gets destroyed along with its valuable values.
StudyHard.main:48	
    Method ‘aveReturn’ is being called.
    A New Stack Frame gets created in the stack.
WorkHard.getAve:64	
    The user entered values are passed on to the method and the values are declared to the instance variables (value1, value2, value3) in the ‘WorkHard’ class.
    Ant the method does its job calculate the average of the three values and stores it in local variable ‘ave’ of type double.
WorkHard.getAve:65	
    The method is asked to return the value.
WorkHard.getAve:67	
    The method reaches its end of its code block and its stack frame gets destroyed along with its valuable values.
StudyHard.main:48	
    The method’s result is returned to the calling class and is caught in the local variable ‘aveReturn’ of type double.
StudyHard.main:51	
    The result is displayed in dialog box to user.
StudyHard.main:60	
    Method ‘shout(lowerCase)’ is being called. And its argument is passed on to the method.
    New stack frame gets created in the stack.
WorkHard.shout:72	
    The argument from the calling class is declared inside the local variable ‘name’ of type String in the method. 
WorkHard.shout:73	
    The result is displayed in a dialog box to user. 
    The received word is changed to upper case using the method ‘input.toUpperCase()’.
WorkHard.shout:79	
    The method reaches its code block and its stack frame gets destroyed along with the valuable word.
StudyHard.main:63	
    Method ‘returnUpperCase’ is being called along with its argument. And local variable ‘returnUpperCase’ of type String is declared to catch the return result from the method.
    New stack frame gets created in the stack.
WorkHard.shout:84	
    The argument passed on from the main class is being declared to the local variable ‘input’ of type String.
WorkHard.shout:85	
    A local variable ‘wordCapital’ of type String is declared to store the converted ‘word’ using method ‘input.toUpperCase()’.
WorkHard.shout:86	
    The local variable ‘wordCapital’ returns the final result.
StudyHard.main:63	
    The local variable ‘returnUpperCase’ catches the returned result from the method ‘returnShout’
StudyHard.main:64	
    The result gets displayed in a dialog box to the user.
StudyHard.main:72	
    Main method reaches end of its code blocks and its stack frame gets destroyed ending this amazing program.
